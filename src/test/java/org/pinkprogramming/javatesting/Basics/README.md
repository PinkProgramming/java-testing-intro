## Exercises

### Test 1. Numerical comparisons

**Step 1**. Structure of tests and syntax for test in JS

Create the file for the tests
 - JS: Make sure to include ".test.js" in the end of the filename
 - Java: Make sure to include "Test" in the end of the filename

Create a named test with a function (JS) method (Java)

**Step 2**. introduce "matchers" or "assertions"

 - JS: For a list of common matchers, refer to [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers)
 - Java: For a list of assertions, refer to [JUnit Examples](https://howtodoinjava.com/junit5/junit-5-assertions-examples/)

### Test 2. String comparisons

_TODO: Verify type is string (JS)_
_TODO: Use helper instead of operator comparison (Java & JS)_
_TODO: How to find a particular word, key or similar_

### Test 3. Introduce array (for strings)

_TODO: Structuring a test for dynamic number of test cases_
